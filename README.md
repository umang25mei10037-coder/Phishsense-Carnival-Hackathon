PhishSense is a high-performance, interactive cybersecurity awareness platform designed to educate users on the mechanics of phishing attacks. 
It was developed by students from VIT Bhopal University specifically for the Carnival Hackathon(2026), combining real-time analysis tools with gamified learning in a modern "cyber-noir" interface.

🚩 The Problem We Solve: Cybercriminals are increasingly using AI and sophisticated social engineering to craft "perfect" phishing lures.
The Scale: Over 3.4 billion phishing emails are sent daily.The Impact: 90% of all data breaches start with a simple phishing link.The Knowledge Gap:
Most users lack a safe environment to "test" suspicious content without risk or find modern ways to learn about evolving threats like Smishing or Whaling.

🚀 Our SolutionPhishSense provides a three-layered defence strategy: Immediate Analysis: A real-time Phishing Scanner and Password Strength Analyzer evaluate potential threats (URLs, emails, messages) using heuristic detection.
Gamified Education: A visual "Spot the Difference" module and an interactive Phishing Quiz train the user's eye to identify red flags like typosquatting.

Actionable Framework:
A 10-point Security Checklist and a localised Cybercrime Reporting Hub (supporting IND, USA, UK, and Global agencies) empower users to take action.

💻 Technologies UsedFrontend Architecture:
Modern Semantic HTML5 and CSS3 utilising Custom Properties for a dynamic theme system.
Styling & UI: * Glassmorphism: High-end translucency effects using backdrop-filter.Responsive Design: Mobile-first approach with CSS Grid and Flexbox.
Interactive Engine: Vanilla JavaScript (ES6+). 
No heavy frameworks were used to ensure near-instant load times and zero-dependency security.
Visual Effects: * HTML5 Canvas API: Custom particle-grid background with mouse-tracking.Intersection Observer API: High-performance "scroll-reveal" animations.

🤖 AI Collaboration & Justification
This project was developed with the assistance of AI (Claude). In today's rapidly evolving tech landscape, we believe this collaboration is not just a choice, but a necessity for the following reasons:

Augmented Creativity: AI served as a high-speed collaborator, allowing us to rapidly prototype complex UI components and refine heuristic logic for threat detection.

The "AI vs. AI" Reality: Since modern phishing attacks are now being generated by AI, it is only logical to use AI-driven development to build the very tools meant to defend against them.

Efficiency & Scalability: AI allowed a small student team to achieve production-level code quality and comprehensive documentation within the tight constraints of a hackathon.
